### Concepts

*For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:*

Background Context
------------------

### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

Starting from today:

-   Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything
-   The intranet checks for Python projects won't be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
-   We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
-   **Don't trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases

Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/tYtzLvssHW_9zR6SZQlNrQ "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:
